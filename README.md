First, I chose Windows 11 as my operating system because it's user-friendly and compatible with most development tools.

I visited the Windows 11 download page and clicked on "Download Now" to get the installation media tool.
Install Windows 11:

I ran the downloaded tool and followed the on-screen instructions to create a bootable USB drive.
After restarting my computer and booting from the USB drive, I followed the installation prompts to complete the installation of Windows 11.
2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Download and Install Visual Studio Code
Next, I needed a good text editor, so I chose Visual Studio Code due to its versatility and extensive plugin support.

Download Visual Studio Code:

I visited the Visual Studio Code download page and downloaded the installer for Windows.
Install Visual Studio Code:

I ran the installer and followed the installation steps. After installation, I launched Visual Studio Code to make sure everything was working properly.
3. Set Up Version Control System
Install Git
Version control is crucial for any development project, so I installed Git to manage my code changes and collaborate with others.

Download Git:

I went to the Git download page and downloaded the installer for Windows.
Install Git:

I ran the installer and followed the installation steps, making sure to select the option to add Git to my system PATH.
Configure Git
Open Git Bash to configure Git with my personal information:
bash

I created a new GitHub account by going to GitHub and signing up Last week.
Initialize a Git Repository

On GitHub, I clicked on "New" to create a new repository named "my-project" and initialized it with a README file.
Clone the Repository:

I copied the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/KGACCOUNTING/your-repository.git).
In Git Bash, I ran:
bash

Navigating to the repository folder:
bash

I created a README file (if it wasn't already present):
bash

Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes
Install Python
Python was the primary language I needed for my project.

Download Python:

I visited the Python download page and downloaded the installer.
Install Python:

I ran the installer and made sure to check the box to add Python to my system PATH. After the installation, I verified it was correctly installed.
Verify Python Installation
Open a command prompt and type:
bash

This showed the installed Python version (e.g., Python 3.10.4).

5. Install Package Managers
Install pip (Python)
Since pip comes with Python, I just needed to verify its installation.

Verify pip Installation:

This confirmed that pip was installed (e.g., pip 21.0.1).
6. Configure a Database (MySQL)
Download and Install MySQL
For database management, I chose MySQL.

Download MySQL:

I visited the MySQL download page and downloaded the installer.
Install MySQL:

I ran the installer and followed the steps to install MySQL, including the MySQL Workbench.
Configure MySQL
Start MySQL Server:
I opened MySQL Workbench and created a new connection to my local MySQL server.
7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional)
Install Docker
To manage development environments and ensure consistency, I decided to install Docker.

Download Docker:

I visited the Docker download page and downloaded Docker Desktop for Windows.
Install Docker:

I ran the installer and followed the steps to install Docker Desktop. After installation, I made sure Docker was running by opening Docker Desktop.
8. Explore Extensions and Plugins
Install Extensions in Visual Studio Code
To enhance my development experience, I explored and installed several useful extensions in Visual Studio Code.

Open Visual Studio Code and go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.

Search for and Install Extensions:

Python: For Python development.
GitLens: For enhanced Git capabilities. <img width="949" alt="Gitlens" src="https://github.com/KGACCOUNTING/Submission/assets/171460313/7429a2bc-7ae8-489f-81ab-6240f62c4cbb">
Docker: For Docker support.
Prettier: For code formatting.

One issue was Git not being recognized in the command prompt. I fixed this by ensuring the installation path was correctly added to the system PATH.
Configuring MySQL was confusing at first. I referred to the MySQL documentation and online tutorials for guidance.
Some Visual Studio Code extensions had overlapping functionalities, which caused conflicts. I resolved this by carefully selecting and configuring each extension.
Explain Solutions:

I used online resources and troubleshooting steps to solve the issues I faced.

Reflection
During the setup process, I encountered a few challenges:

Git Installation: Initially, Git was not recognized in the command prompt. I had to ensure that the installation path was correctly added to the system PATH variable.
MySQL Configuration: Configuring MySQL server settings was a bit confusing. I referred to the MySQL documentation and various online tutorials to set up a local MySQL server successfully.
Extension Conflicts in Visual Studio Code: Some extensions had overlapping functionalities, causing conflicts. I resolved this by carefully selecting and configuring each extension.
By documenting each step and troubleshooting effectively, I was able to set up a robust developer environment conducive to productive coding and collaboration.
